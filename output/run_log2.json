The primary focus is on understanding how these models can be used to analyze and potentially predict antibody behavior, particularly in the context of antigen binding.\n\n**Supported Claims:**\n\n*   **Antibody-Antigen Conformation:** Language models can be used to analyze antibody-antigen interactions, focusing on the conformation of the bound complex rather than requiring the antigen sequence or its atomic coordinates (S#1).\n*   **Self-Supervised Learning:** Self-supervised learning methods are being employed to decipher the \"language\" of antibodies (S#2).\n*   **Affinity Maturation:** Studies have investigated local and global rigidification processes during antibody affinity maturation (S#3). This suggests that changes in amino acid properties can impact the strength of antigen binding.\n*   **Antigen Binding Site:** Affinity maturation can influence the antigen-binding site of antibodies (S#4).\n\n**Weak Claims (Downgraded):**\n\n*   The provided evidence does not directly quantify the proportion of antibodies exhibiting antigen affinity or the ranges observed in recent studies, as requested in the refined retrieval query. The evidence focuses more on the *process* of affinity maturation and the use of language models.\n\n**Falsifiable Hypothesis:**\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** Higher language model likelihood scores for specific amino acid sequences within the CDR3 region of an antibody correlate with increased binding affinity to a target antigen.\n\n**Evidence Table:**\n\n| Claim                                                    | Snippet Reference |\n| :------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------- |\n| Antibody-Antigen Conformation                          | S#1               |\n| Self-Supervised Learning for Antibody Analysis          | S#2               |\n| Affinity Maturation and Rigidification                  | S#3               |\n| Influence of Affinity Maturation on Antigen Binding Site | S#4               |",

The primary focus is on understanding how these models can be used to analyze and potentially predict antibody behavior, particularly in the context of antigen binding.\n\n**Supported Claims:**\n\n*   **Antibody-Antigen Conformation:** Language models can be used to analyze antibody-antigen interactions, focusing on the conformation of the bound complex rather than requiring the antigen sequence or its atomic coordinates (S#1).\n*   **Self-Supervised Learning:** Self-supervised learning methods are being employed to decipher the \"language\" of antibodies (S#2).\n*   **Affinity Maturation:** Studies have investigated local and global rigidification processes during antibody affinity maturation (S#3). This suggests that changes in amino acid properties can impact the strength of antigen binding.\n*   **Antigen Binding Site:** Affinity maturation can influence the antigen-binding site of antibodies (S#4).\n\n**Weak Claims (Downgraded):**\n\n*   The provided evidence does not directly quantify the proportion of antibodies exhibiting antigen affinity or the ranges observed in recent studies, as requested in the refined retrieval query. The evidence focuses more on the *process* of affinity maturation and the use of language models.\n\n**Falsifiable Hypothesis:**\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** Higher language model likelihood scores for specific amino acid sequences within the CDR3 region of an antibody correlate with increased binding affinity to a target antigen.\n\n**Evidence Table:**\n\n| Claim                                                    | Snippet Reference |\n| :------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------- |\n| Antibody-Antigen Conformation                          | S#1               |\n| Self-Supervised Learning for Antibody Analysis          | S#2               |\n| Affinity Maturation and Rigidification                  | S#3               |\n| Influence of Affinity Maturation on Antigen Binding Site | S#4               |"
